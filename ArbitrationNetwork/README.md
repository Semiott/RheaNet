# SuffrageNet
Computational Integrity Information Architecture for Electronic Voting using Zero Knowledge Proof Frameworks.

## Inspiration

Concept of Quadratic Voting and how it can help to address the voice of minorities. Quadratic voting is a collective decision-making procedure where individuals allocate votes to express the degree of their preferences, rather than just the direction of their preferences. By doing so, quadratic voting helps enable users to address issues of voting paradox and majority rule. Following privacy preserving computational integrity information architectures are also inspirations.

- Minimal Anti Collusion Infrastructure from Applied ZKP
- Semaphore Signaling Framework from Applied ZKP

## What it does

- Generates a prover - verifier infrastructure for constructing the proofs of minority votes.
- Generated privacy preserving vote infrastructure using Zero Knowledge Proofs
- Ability to execute Quadratic Voting Algorithms to make sure minority voices are addressed

## How I built it

- Circom Circuit Compiler generated computational integrity proofs
- Proofs are generated in Web Assembly. Proofs are translated to Solidity Smart Contracts. 

## Challenges I ran into
- Compilation of Semaphore Smart Contracts.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

- Integration of Semaphore Framework into Electronic Voting
- Identification of Quadratic Voting Concept for Minority Voting

## What I learned

- Power of Zero Knowledge Proofs
- Power of Semaphore Signaling Framework
- Power of Quadratic Voting Concept

## What's next for SuffrageNet

- Deployment into Matic Network
- Development of a Wallet
- Development of a Dashboard
